# Meatify
A "web application" that personalizes your meat eating experience for a balanced diet.

## Story
The idea came from a friend who wanted to find a way to promote more Chicken Breast consumption. Using tech buzzwords to reel people into the site, no matter what people input in the form, the output will always be: "Chicken Breast."

## Setup
Setup the node modules
```
npm init
```
Start the server
```
